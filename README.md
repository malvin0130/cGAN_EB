# CGAN for load generation with PV and EV
This repo includes the cGAN model and its training process as well as some generated samples of load profiles under different labels.

## Project Details
- [cGAN.py](./cGAN.py) - Model structure
- [train.py](./train.py) - Model training
- [utils.py](./utils.py) - Results analysis
- [cGAN Generation](./cGAN Generation) - Generated load profiles for different PV/EV labels

## Usage
1. Sample days of generated data from [cGAN Generation](./cGAN Generation) for the PV/EV status needed.
2. Aggregate to get complete profile
